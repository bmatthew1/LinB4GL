<h1>What are plugin DLLs?</h1>

<p>Plugin DLLs are dll files written especially for Basic4GL.
When you &quot;plug-in&quot; a DLL, it extends the Basic4GL
language, giving you new commands that you can use in your
programs. For example, a plugin DLL might give you new commands
to play midi files, access the CD drive, load and render 3D
models, call OpenGL commands from later versions or print to a
printer.</p>

<p>Plugin DLLs allow programmers to extend Basic4GL without
having to alter the main Basic4GL source code. Anyone with a
reasonable grasp of C/C++ can create a Basic4GL plugin and
distribute it to other Basic4GL users.</p>

<h1>Where can I find them?</h1>

<p>Check the <a href="http://www.basic4gl.net">Basic4GL homepage</a>
and the <a href="http://basic4gl.wikispaces.com/">Basic4GL wiki
page</a>. Note that at the time of writing, plugin DLLs are
relatively new, so there are no dedicated areas for them. These
will be created soon.</p>

<p>People often announce their DLLs in the <a
href="http://basic4gl.proboards20.com/">Basic4GL discussion forum</a>,
so check there also.</p>

<h1>How do I use them in my Basic4GL programs?</h1>

<p>Like so:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Download the plugin DLL file.</li>
    <li>Move/copy it to your Basic4GL program folder (by default
        this is C:\Program files\Basic4GL).</li>
    <li>Start Basic4GL, click &quot;Program&quot; (on the main
        menu) then &quot;Plug-in Libraries...&quot;</li>
    <li>The &quot;Plugin chooser&quot; window pops up. Find the
        plugin DLL file and click the tickbox.</li>
</ol>

<p>If all goes well, the plugin will be installed into Basic4GL.
You can now close the plugin chooser and use the new commands in
your program.</p>

<p>If not, refer to this trouble-shooter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The plugin DLL file does not appear in the &quot;Plugin
        chooser&quot;.<br>
        This can happen if the DLL file is not a Basic4GL plugin
        dll. Plugin DLLs must be especially written for Basic4GL.
        DLLs for other programs will not work.<br>
        Also, the version of the plugin DLL may not be compatible
        with the version of Basic4GL. Be sure you have the most
        recent version of both the plugin, and Basic4GL.<br>
        </li>
    <li>A message box pops up when you tick the DLL in the
        &quot;Plugin chooser&quot;.<br>
        This is the plugin DLL telling you the reason why it
        could not load. Some plugin DLLs require other plugin
        DLLs to be loaded beforehand. If the plugin DLL author is
        user friendly, then the message should hopefully give you
        an idea of what the problem is, and how to fix it.<br>
        Otherwise you may need to contact the author of the DLL
        for any further trouble-shooting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Plugin DLLs stay loaded for the duration of your
Basic4GL session, or until you create or load a new program.
Every time you create a new program, you will need to choose
which plugins you wish to use for that program. When you save
your program to disk, Basic4GL automatically remembers which
plugins are used, and will automatically load them the next time
your program is opened.</p>

<h1>How do I know what the new commands are?</h1>

<p>After you've placed the tick next to a plugin DLL, hover the
mouse over the name of the DLL. A mouse hint window should appear
listing the new commands.<br>
This is just a rough guide however, as it doesn't tell you
exactly how the commands are used or what they do. Ideally the
DLL author will include instructions along with his/her DLL
describing how it is used.</p>

<h1>Standalone exes</h1>

<p>If you create a standalone exe of a Basic4GL program that uses
plugin DLLs, then you must distribute those DLLs with your
standalone exe. </p>

<h1>Are plugin DLLs safe?</h1>

<p>Basic4GL plugin DLLs can be potentially unsafe.</p>

<p>Basic4GL is designed to be a safe language, and every attempt
is made to ensure it is stable, and that a malicious Basic4GL
program (whether written deliberately or accidentally) will not
damage your system.</p>

<p>However, plugin DLLs are written in C/C++ and can interact
directly with your system. Basic4GL cannot restrict what a plugin
DLL does. If a plugin allows overwriting files in your system
directory, then someone could use it to write a Basic4GL program
that does exactly that.<br>
You should also be aware that even if a plugin was written with
the best intentions, it can still contain bugs that can make it,
and therefore Basic4GL, unstable.</p>

<p>Therefore using a plugin DLL is an exercise in trust and
common sense should be used.<br>
If you know and trust the authors intentions (and programming
ability) and/or if a large number of people use a DLL (and aren't
complaining about it) then you can generally expect it to be
safe.</p>

<p>Note: All plugin DLLs downloadable from the Basic4GL homepage
are believed to be safe (by me, the author of Basic4GL).</p>

<h1>How can I create my own plugin DLLs?</h1>

<p>To create a DLL, you will need:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To be reasonably confident at writing C++ code.</li>
    <li>A C++ compiler. I can recommend <a
        href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Codeblocks</a> which is
        free.<br>
        The Basic4GL plugin SDK contains projects for Codeblocks
        and the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 compiler.<br>
        Any other decent Windows C++ compiler should also work,
        but you will need to create and configure the project
        yourself.</li>
    <li>The Basic4GL plugin SDK. Downloadable from the <a
        href="http://www.basic4gl.net">Basic4GL homepage</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Further instructions are provided in the plugin SDK.</p>
