<h1>What is Basic4GL?</h1>

<p>Welcome to Basic4GL! Basic4GL is a compiler and virtual
machine that allows you to write and run programs written in the
Basic4GL programming language. This language is based on the
traditional BASIC language but with support for modern and
relevant technologies, most importantly OpenGL.<br>
Basic4GL is written for Microsoft Windows 98 and upwards
(although ports to other platforms such as Linux and MacOS may
come later).</p>

<p>I had two goals when I started writing Basic4GL:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To make OpenGL easy.<br>
        In essence OpenGL is quite straight forward to learn and
        use, but the amount of setup code can be daunting to
        first-timers and make it seem a lot more complicated than
        it actually is. Basic4GL automatically sets up everything
        for you, so you can start writing OpenGL code from line
        one.</li>
    <li>To make a free, safe and easy to learn programming
        language for people who are new to programming to
        experiment in, and perhaps discover that programming is
        not quite as arcane and mysterious as many people make
        out! <br>
        Basic4GL is designed to be safe, so that programs never
        cause access violations or crash or hang the computer
        (note: while I can't guarantee all of this, in my
        experience Basic4GL has been extremely stable and
        reliable.) It is also based on the BASIC programming
        language (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction
        Code) which was designed to be a easy to use and easy to
        learn for beginners.<br>
        I learned to program when I was 8 years old, by typing
        programs into a Commodore VIC-20 from instruction manuals
        and books. These programs were written in BASIC, and
        without that free introductory language I might never
        have become the professional programmer I am today. Today
        there seems to be a wide gap in this area and I hope that
        Basic4GL goes some way towards filling it.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, Basic4GL is a programming language with training
wheels, but based on relevant modern technology.</p>

<p>If you're new to programming, or new to OpenGL, or if you just
want a quick and easy environment for experimenting with OpenGL
then Basic4GL is designed for you.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>Windows 98 or more recent.<br>
3D accellerated video card.<br>
A decent system. Basically the faster the PC and video card, the
more detailed and complex programs you can run at an acceptable
speed.<br>
The demo programs all run fine on a P2-350 with a NVidia TNT
based graphics card.</p>

<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>Run Basic4GL.exe. If all goes well, the Basic4GL editor will
come up, empty. If Basic4GL can't setup OpenGL, you may need to
select a different graphics mode and restart </p>

<p>Open an existing Basic4GL program:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click &quot;Program&quot; on the menu bar. </li>
    <li>Click &quot;Open...&quot; in the drop down menu. </li>
    <li>Double click the &quot;Programs&quot; folder. </li>
    <li>Double click a Basic4GL program, e.g.
        &quot;CubePyramidDemo.gb&quot; </li>
</ol>

<p>Run the program by either:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Selecting &quot;Program|Run! / Stop!&quot; from the main
        menu, OR </li>
    <li>Click the green &quot;Go!&quot; icon on the toolbar, OR </li>
    <li>Press F9 or F5 </li>
</ol>

<p>The program should run. Press the Escape key to halt it and
return to the Basic4GL editor.</p>

<h1>Basic4GL video modes</h1>

<p>You can set the Basic4GL video modes by clicking
&quot;Basic4GL|Options...&quot;.<br>
In the resulting dialog box you can specify how Basic4GL program
output will be displayed.</p>

<p>The most significant choice is the &quot;Fullscreen&quot;
checkbox.<br>
In fullscreen mode, Basic4GL will switch your monitor to the
resolution and colour depth you specify. The Basic4GL program
will have control of the entire monitor screen until the program
terminates, or you close it by pressing the Escape key.</p>

<p>When not in full screen, the Basic4GL output is displayed in
another window.<br>
The width and height that you specify are used as the size of the
window, and will use the current colour depth of the desktop.</p>

<h2>Choosing the right mode</h2>

<p>The most compatible mode is:<br>
Fullscreen<br>
Width = 640<br>
Height = 480<br>
Colour Depth = 16 Bit</p>

<p>If that doesn't work for you, then Basic4GL may not be able to
run on your computer.</p>

<p>Higher resolution modes look nicer, but require more hardware
power to run fast, and older (or cheaper) video cards may not
support them.<br>
Likewise with 32 Bit Colour Depth.</p>

<p>You may need to experiment to find the optimal setting for
your hardware.</p>

<h1>Running programs</h1>

<p>This is fairly simple.</p>

<p>First you put a program into Basic4GL, by either loading one
or typing one in. (Select &quot;Program|Open...&quot; to load a
program. The demonstration programs are in the
&quot;Programs&quot; subfolder.)</p>

<p>Then you run the program by selecting &quot;Program|Run! /
Stop!&quot; from the menu or by clicking the green
&quot;Go!&quot; icon, or pressing F5 or F9 :-).</p>

<h2>Program errors</h2>

<p>If there's an error in the program, it won't run. Instead,
Basic4GL will display the error on the status bar and place the
cursor where the problem occurs.</p>

<p>You will need to correct the problem before Basic4GL can run
the program.<br>
This may involve obtaining the correct version of the program (if
someone else wrote it), or correcting it yourself, or reloading
the program (incase you might have accidentally typed something
into the program.)</p>

<h1>Where to now?</h1>

<ul>
    <li>For those who are new to programming, there are some
        general purpose programming tutorials planned. However,
        until I get the time to write them!, you might want to
        try experimenting with the demo programs, or visit the
        Basic4GL message board: <a
        href="http://basic4gl.proboards20.com/">http://basic4gl.proboards20.com/</a></li>
    <li>For those who are new to OpenGL, there are some OpenGL
        tutorials that I also haven't had time to write yet!
        Until then you may want to try NeHe's OpenGL tutorials: <a
        href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/">http://nehe.gamedev.net/</a>.
        Basic4GL conversions of tutorials 2,3,4,5,6,7,9 and 11
        are available in the &amp;ldquoPrograms&amp;rdquo folder.</li>
    <li>Experienced programmers may want to read over the <a
        href="Programmer's%20guide.htm">Programmer's Guide</a> or
        the <a href="Language%20guide.htm">Language Guide</a> for
        specifics about the Basic4GL language and its libraries.</li>
    <li>Likewise OpenGL programmers may want to read the <a
        href="OpenGL%20guide.htm">OpenGL guide</a> for specifics
        about Basic4GL's interface to OpenGL.</li>
</ul>
