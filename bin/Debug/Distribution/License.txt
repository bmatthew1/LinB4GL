BASIC4GL LICENSE

Basic4GL remains property of the author Thomas Mulgrew.
You may use Basic4GL free of charge.
You may redistribute Basic4GL, by distributing the original archive file with all files included and unmodified. You may not charge for this redistribution.


CORONA IMAGE INPUT/OUTPUT LIBRARY

The Corona Image Input/Output library is used internally by Basic4GL, and is distributed under the Zlib license (http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.html or see the ZLib LibPNG license.txt file).


AUDIERE SOUND LIBRARY

The Audiere Audio library is used internally by Basic4GL, and is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
(See the LGPL.txt file).


STANDALONE EXECUTABLES

Executable files created with Basic4GL's "Create Standalone .exe" functions are joint intellectual property, of:
1. The author of Basic4GL
2. The author(s) of the third party libraries that Basic4GL includes
3. The author(s) of the Basic4GL format program (that was used to create the .exe file)

The third party libraries remain under their respective licenses, in particular the Corona Image Input/Output library remains covered by the ZLib license, and the Audiere Audio library remains covered by the LGPL license.

The author of Basic4GL grants the author(s) of the Basic4GL format program the right to distribute the standalone executable file as they see fit, including as a free or commercial program provided that the executable file is generated by an official Basic4GL version and has not since been modified in any way, except by being compressed by an official UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) version.

The authors of the Basic4GL format program are free to introduce extra conditions on the executable or grant extra privileges, based on their ownership of the Basic4GL format program part, so long as they do not contradict any of the existing restrictions.


(In simpler language this means you can create a standalone executable from a Basic4GL program that you wrote and distribute it or sell it as you see fit, but you cannot modify the file after Basic4GL generates it.)


NO WARRANTY

There is no warranty for Basic4GL. Use Basic4GL at your own risk. Neither the author (Thomas Mulgrew) nor any other contributers will be held responsible for any damages that may arise from the use of Basic4GL.
Likewise there is no warranty for any executable file that Basic4GL creates.


By using the software you are agreeing to these terms.
